    <div class="row">

            <section class="s1">
                <h2>Section 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing significant and/or intresting is coming to my mind right now. Hence, I am going to type my thoghts right now.

            <section class="s2">
                <h2>Section 2</h2>
                <p>
                    This section is no different, this also consists of random gibberish stuff. Hence, i suggest you save yourselves some time and skip reading this.

                    I wonder if someone's even bothered this far to look into the paragraphs. If so, then I thank you for reading and please do rate my work.
